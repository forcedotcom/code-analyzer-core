    The chains of influence statements::

        A.foo -> B.bar in element foo
        B -> C in element bar

    are stored for reporting.

    Data Influence Paths are immutable. When flow propagation occurs,
    new paths are created and old paths kept until the variable is reassigned.

    This is accomplished by maintaining an influence_map::
      (flow_path, elem_name) -> set(DataInfluencePaths)

    that tracks all influencers. If a combination of values influences
    a variable, we *copy* paths for these values, append them, and assign
    them to the influencer. So the usual operations are copy flow + extend.
    When assignment happens, we change which flows a given variable points
    to, and let python garbage collection delete flows when no variable
    points to them.

    When symbolic execution exits a subflow,
    all paths that do not influence a return value are
    dropped.
