# CRUD Operation Data in User Mode

This is not a vulnerability but an informational notice that the flow allows the user data to 
modify a specific object/field. All permissions are respected.

This information may be useful for administrators and auditors who are trying to determine
which fields a given set of flows is accessing without needing to manually audit the flows.
