This directory stores integration test data.

These tests may make callouts, write data to disk, etc.

Note that code is copied into this directory
from the scratch org directory in order to have
stable test cases, but first ensure the code
runs as expected by deploying it to a scratch
org and confirming it is vulnerable or safe
before creating a test case based on it.
